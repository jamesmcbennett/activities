    <p>For future enhancements, other CS50 students could consider implementing features such as a more precise marker placement on the map,
        creating a global circumnavigation route that combines various activities like swimming, rowing, running, cycling, and hiking,
        engaging in friendly competitions with friends, family, or your community to visualize everyone's positions on the map, sending emails
        or some kind of updates as users arrive at major cities along their routes, or the ambitious yet valuable task of integrating with the Strava or Garmin APIs for automatic
        activity updates. This integration would allow users to effortlessly monitor their progress on the map without the need for manual
        data entry.</p>
